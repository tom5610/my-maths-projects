    "Modern, pure mathematics is primarily concerned with `statements` about mathematical objects. Mathematical objects are things such as: Integers, real number, sets, functions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only mathematicians interested in statements, they are, above all, interested in knowing which statements are true and which are false. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ancient Greek mathematicians seem to have been the first to notice that all mathematical statements can be expressed using one of these simple forms, and they made a systematic study of the language involved, namely the terms `and`, `or`, `not`, `implies`, `for all`, and `there exists`. They provided universally accepted meaning of these key terms and analyzed their bahavior. Today this formal mathematical study is know as `formal logic` or `mathematical logi`."

Because the floor is uneven, the table wobbles. One solution is to fold a small piece of paper and insert it under one leg until the table is stable. But there is another solution. Simply by rotating the table you will be able to position it so it does not wobble. Prove this. [WARNING: This is a thinking-outside-the-box question. The solution is simple, but it can take a lot of effort before you find it.
